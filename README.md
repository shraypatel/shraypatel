## Hi, I’m Shray 👋  

- Computer Engineering @ McMaster  
- Firmware Engineering Intern @ [Synopsys](https://www.synopsys.com/)
- Prev Data Engineering Intern @ [SunLife](https://www.sunlife.com/en/)
- Prev Systems Firmware Engineer Lead @ [MIST](https://mcmasterneudose.ca/) Satellite Club 

Systems / firmware + ML systems  

Currently working on:
- C-based systems software for PCIe architectures  
- Embedded firmware (STM32, FreeRTOS, CubeSat OBC)  
- High-performance ML kernels (CUDA, SIMD, multithreading)  

I like building things that sit close to the hardware and scale well.
